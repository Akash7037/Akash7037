# Line Following IOT 
A line-following robot is an autonomous machine that can follow a predefined path, typically marked by a black or white line on the ground. Using an Arduino Uno and 2 IR (infrared) sensors, you can build a simple and effective line-following robot.
# Components 
- Arduino Uno
- 2 Ir sensor (obstacles avoid sensor)
- Driver module (L298N)
- 2 Dc motors
- chassis
- Batteries
# connection 
## IR sensor 
- Ir gnd = Arudino gnd
- Ir vcc = arudino 5v
- Ir out (left) = Arudino 2
- Ir out (right) = Arduino 3
